a protocol to express RDF data.

CR design goals:
* Be human readable and writable
* Express RDF data
* Be a superset of YAML (or at least inspired by it).
* Be writable in Markdown.

Make syntax highlighting for CR (at least in Vim).
Make folding scheme for CR (at least in Vim).

CR should have facilities for:
* annotating the document without resulting in RDF triples:
 - sections (use # ## ### as usual for Markdown)
 - comments which should not be translated to RDF (which wildcats?)
* expressing triples:
 -  string objects (and other data)
 -  multiple subject, object and predicate URIs (and data objects)
* enriching descriptions of triples to render natural language texts
