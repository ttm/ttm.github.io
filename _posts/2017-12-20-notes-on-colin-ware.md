### Preface
On the beginning, Colin 
says important facts about dataViz, such as the great bandwidth
of the visual channel and the proximity of the visual and overall cognition.

In describing chapter 3, he states that the visual system
does not measure the amount of light, but changes in light and color.
This is very similar to the (auditory) relative pitch perception.

### Chap 1
p1: describes the physics-centric view of the sciences
as shortsighted and having psychology as dummy and sociology
neighboring astrology.

p2: - cognitive systems are way beyond a person's head:
it uses cognitive tools and operates within social networks.
- human-computer system enhanced by visual interactive interface.
