From September 3rd to 6th
I participated in the 16th
Brazilian Symposium on Computer Music
([SBCM2017](http://compmus.ime.usp.br/sbcm/2017/))
and presented the [Vivace livecoding language and
platform](https://github.com/ttm/cmj-vivace/raw/master/sbcm/sbcm2017-template.pdf).
Here is a [screencast where I recorded the presentation when practicing](https://youtu.be/EKUz3M9kPBI). 
The final presentation was better, but the screencast
is good enough.
Here are [the slides](https://github.com/ttm/cmj-vivace/blob/master/sbcm/presentation.md)
I used.
Most importantly, for me:
* I got in touch with the Romanian-American composer [Tipei](http://ems.music.uiuc.edu/people/tipei/).
He had very interesting thoughts on musical theory, history and computer
music.
* People liked the work on Vivace quite a lot and kept asking me about
  it and making explicit their appreciation of the work and intentions
  of usage.
* I learned about recent work of a number of researchers that interests
  me: [Tiago Tavares](http://www.dca.fee.unicamp.br/~tavares/),
  [Flávio Schiavoni](http://dcomp.ufsj.edu.br/~fls/),
  [Marcelo Queiroz](https://www.ime.usp.br/~mqz/)
  and [José Padovani](http://zepadovani.info/),
  to name just a few.
* Learned about the possibilities of decomposing a signal
into AM and FM modulators with Antonio Goulart.
* Learned some bits about Ubiquitous music from [Damián Keller](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~dkeller/).
* Learned a bit about recognizing features of specific genres of music
from [Xavier Serra](https://www.upf.edu/web/xavier-serra).
* Grasped some interesting considerations about blending harmonies from
  different genres from [Emilios Cambouropoulos](http://users.auth.gr/emilios/).
* Listened to interesting musical pieces in the daily concerts.
* I applied to become a member of the
[Brazilian Committee for Computer
Music](http://www.sbc.org.br/14-comissoes/385-computacao-musical).
* Some other stuff I don't recall at the moment but might add to this
  list.
