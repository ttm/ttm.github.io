For reaching the desired confidence on topological and linguistic 
properties found on social systems, I decided to publish a collection of linked open social
data from Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, IRC, GMANE email lists, Participabr, Cidade Democr√°tica and AA.

All data are in currently not in a SparQL endpoint, but available as [plain RDF text in git repositories][gh].
Routines for the translation of raw and relational data into linked data (RDF) are in repos of [my github account][ttmgh],
 specially in the percolation, social, gmane, participation and music python packages.
