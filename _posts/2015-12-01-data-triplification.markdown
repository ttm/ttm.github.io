For reaching the desired confidence on topological and linguistic 
properties found on social systems, I decided to publish a collection of linked open social
data from Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, IRC, GMANE email lists, Participabr, Cidade Democr√°tica and AA.

All data are in currently not in a SparQL endpoint, but available as [plain RDF text in git repositories][ttmgh].
