I enhanced my laptop environment recently with:
* Byobu: for avoiding many terminal tabs and windows
* Vim 8: for True Color, python scripting and latest improvements.

There are many other things I can improve, and this post will
be dedicated to them:
* A keyboard shortcut to open sound configuration window.

Vim:
* Mappings:
  - to join a window into another tab.
		Just get the buffer number, close the window,
		move to the tab, open the buffer.
	- To put a final char in each of the next N lines.
* a mapping 
* Make the real-time updating of the logging file work.
* Learn better about what is new in version 8.
* Get more syntax highlighting plugins.
* Learn the right way to add tokens to the spell checking repertoire.
* AA plugin to send messages from inside vim.
* Work with compilation of latex files from inside vim.

IPython:
* Make an intensive study on using and making magic commands.
* Remember how to use IPython's functionalities (e.g. PDb).
* Check the plugins to know what are the useful stuff out there.

Byobu:
* Learn tmux better and how Byobu communicates with tmux.
* Know about the plugins.

MOOCs, books and articles:
* Make some items in the [articles] post to present the numerous
results I already have.
* MOOCs on:
	- data visualization;
	- web development;
	- python programming for specific tasks (e.g. SNA);
	- English writing;
	- audio and music;
	- complex networks;
	- text mining;
	- Make the enthough courses;
* Books on data visualization:
	- Munzner
	- Ward
	- Ware
	- The two visual analytics
	- The doctorate thesis
	- The book from 9X's.

Other:
	- Get nice teas.

Such as the post on the [articles], I will keep updating this list.
The date means only the day when I started it.
