Just got back from Rio de Janeiro.
Two weeks in a row participating in [Labicbr][labicbr],
a nice Iberoamerican gathering for citizen innovation
([pics and interaction][labicpll]).

We developed and tested a prototype of a connective and artistic
hardware and software technology designed to ease social participation:
[the magic box][mbox]. I helped mainly with [data visualization and
semantic web support][repocm].
The main repositories of the project are [here][cmp],
it might interest also the (closed) [Caixa MÃ¡gica fb group][cmg].

Overall, the event was marked by knowledge exchange and relationships
for the development and understanding of citizenship.
It was mostly important, for me, as a way to enhance and secure directions
taken in art, technological developments and scientific research.
