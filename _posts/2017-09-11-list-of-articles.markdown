There are many documents I have written or idealized in the
past years.
Most of these documents are scientific articles and
have some code (usually Python or JavaScript)
with which I express and validate them.

The issue that made this post come to be is:
they are scattered in many repositories, emails,
online drafts and personal notes.
I frequently come across stuff I had forgotten
and that are useful to understand more recent work
I have done and to help others deepen into the subjects.

Thus, this post should be a list of these ideas.
The very few of them I sent to publication were accepted so far,
and I should distinguish them at least between: idealized, written and published.

Here it goes.
For now I have made only a list of the unpublished ideas and
did not differentiate the ones I have written about from the ones which
have not received a 'natural language' documentation:
* Decomposition of a (original) sound using any other sound as the basis.
The basis sound should be used in many scales to represent the original
sound reasonably well.
The idea is simply to multiply one sound by the other sample-by-sample
and then sum. This is the scalar multiplication of one sound by the
other, i.e. the magnitude of the projection of one sound into the other.
* A scientific account of the [AirHackTable](http://wiki.nosdigitais.teia.org.br/AirHackTable)
* Meta-sieves: mathematical structures to be mapped to sound.
This idea is very incipient and I don't know how much it makes sense
within the framework proposed by Xenakis.
Meta-sieves are at the moment conceptualized (by me) as any mathematical
structure that filters a given domain: a probabilistic distribution,
a group, a ring, etc.
* A very brief account of the [MASS](https://github.com/ttm/dissertacao/raw/master/article/acm/sample-acmsmall.pdf)
framework for describing musical elements in PCM audio.
This document should contain only the equations, algorithms and very brief
explanations.
* A description of the Social Participation Ontologies we developed.
This [technical report](https://github.com/ttm/pnud5/raw/master/latex/produto.pdf)
has directions to find them all.
* A description of the recommendation and classification systems we conceived for social
  participation.
  This [technical report](https://github.com/ttm/pnud3/blob/master/latex/produto.pdf)
  has some notes and algorithms on them.
* A description of the experiments on collection and diffusion of
  information we performed and explained in the last appendix of this
  [doctoral thesis](https://github.com/ttm/thesis/raw/master/thesis-rfabbri.pdf).
* Psychophysical experiments with the MASS framework mentioned above
(maybe with emphasis on the sonic pictures).
* Complex networks gradus ad Parnassum: a tutorial on complex networks.
Maybe include a vocabulary and ontology for complex networks (and anthropological physics).
  theory and harnessing.
* The Scientific Style: a very short account on the overall structure of
  scientific articles (consider at least the most often templates).
* Analysis of the Toki Pona language and an exposition of the Vim
  text highlighting implemented.
* The network layout implementations made for [ccNetViz](https://github.com/ttm/ccNetViz/).
* Enhancement on the description and simulation of the Doppler effect by
  considering also the variation of the intensity of the wave.
  (Find out if this is really not yet described in the literature).
* Integral serialism with permutations and algebraic groups (for musical
  composition).
* Vocabulary and Ontology for the MASS framework mentioned above.
* Deepen the concept of the [Anthropological Physics](http://www.academia.edu/10356773/What_are_you_and_I_anthropological_physics_fundamentals_).
* Finish the [analysis of the work by Machado de Assis by text mining](https://sourceforge.net/p/labmacambira/rcpln/ci/master/tree/pln/trabLetras/resumoLetras.pdf?format=raw).
* Describe the process of constructing OWL ontologies from raw data.
This process is very briefly described in this [doctoral thesis](https://github.com/ttm/thesis/raw/master/thesis-rfabbri.pdf).
* Sonic doin: using continuous and intermittent sounds for therapy.
We should use the MASS framework (mentioned above) for this.
* About AA, what it is, what it is not and how it can be harnessed.
* About the music Python Package to synthesize music.
* Differences perceived in timbre when the amplitude of the components are preserved and only the phases change.
* Spectra of sound generated by using different distribution probabilities for the PCM samples.
* Articles for the courses in [music in PCM audio](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O8y-W27P_ydeOXd97HBtLEeI0C0-IMhfq6AKWmqDW10/edit?usp=sharing) and in [research and development with open technologies](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tPY1OedvmLzdIga0uK7DSH6j2UDcXEmZxOL_Kz2K3VI/edit?usp=sharing).
For them, I need to find suitable journals and/or conferences to submit the works.
Maybe talk to João Bueno, Jane Borges or seek other partners in the pedagogy field.
* Make and describe a musical piece made with MASS that uses: the Doppler effect, spatial localization, reverberation, permutations, hiper vibratos and tremolos (with depth and frequency not achievable in traditional instruments), AM and FM between the sounds, etc.
* Hypersimplicity: an aesthetic based on few notes (3 trios, PPEPPS, FIGGS).
* Implementation of peals (change ringing) in Python (implement 3 trios at least, make expansions).
* An article about audiovisual analytics conceptualization (including time-variant interfaces that uses the perception rhythms).
Include AAVO and a design and implementation possibilities (with emphasis on web, sandbox, user shareable states, etc).
* A description of the musical compositions endeavors I've made
(and include the musics, videos, texts and scripts which I can recover).
* Vocoder via Fourier, wavelets, other established bases and arbitrary bases (any sound actually).
* Routines for generation music from arbitrary structures (e.g. sound files, permutations, groups, peals, scales, rhythms...)
* Describe the Erdõs sectioning in further detail:
  - Can use (in-out)degree or (in-out) strengths or a combination of them.
  - Implement a python toolbox to perform the sectioning (classification)
  - Make it available through algorithmia
  - Explain the naming (why sectioning and not partitioning (sectorialization?), why Erdõs?); it is a shorthand for "sectioning of the network vertices into the hubs, intermediary and peripheral vertices by a comparison of the connectivity distribution against that of an Erdös-Rényi model.
  - Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of current implementation:
    * Strengths: well behaved; true to the qualitative description
    * Weaknesses: using the degree mean to derive the sectioning while the mean is nos to meaningful in scale-free networks;
    problems with sampling and oscillation of the histogram;
    might not be the best method for any network and might classify vertices when it is not meaninful;
    there might be better to consider another number of classes of vertices
  - History and context of the concept of hubs, intermediary and peripheral vertices
  - Possibilities of other ways to perform the sectioning:
    * spectral graph theory
    * dry cut with percentages of hubs (~1-5%) intermediary (~10-25%) and peripheral (~60-85%)
    * percentages derived from characteristics of the graph
  - (Human) Typology derived from the sectioning, why it is ~ok (less prompt to yield stigmatization because it varies in time, scale and network)
  - Further work:
    * Consider heterogeneous (e.g. bipartite) networks and multigraphs
    * Address the Weaknesses described.
* A consideration of the German lexicographical tradition for the semantic web:
  - Results in terms of the contributions to current semantic web
  - Possibilities of usage of the established lexicons for SKOS vocabularies and OWL ontologies 
  - Possibilities of the usage of the methodologies
* A description of the Common Ontology (CO):
  - Includes bonding SKOS and OWL and URIs for expressing potential relations [[1]]
* A description of the Common Resource (CR) protocol:
  - Text written RDF triples bonding at least Markup language (and other resources in personal notes)
  - Describe the Common Ontology in CR
  - Envision possibilities to write algorithms in Coffescript and a condensed notation for Python
* Describe meta-vibratos (vibratos with a secondary oscillatory pattern, VV in MASS)
and meta-tremolos. Describe their implementation with and without glissandi (PV in MASS).
Achieve a general implementation for any number of oscillatory patterns and transitions.
* Think about the implications of using Weber and Fechner and Steven's Laws for loudness (and pitch!).
What are the implications and the implementations.
