There are many documents I have written or idealized in the
past years.
Most of these documents are scientific articles and
have some code (usually Python or JavaScript)
with which I express and validate them.

The issue that made this post come to be is:
they are scattered in many repositories, emails,
online drafts and personal notes.
I frequently come across stuff I had forgotten
and that are useful to understand more recent work
I have done and to help others deepen into the subjects.

Thus, this post should be a list of these ideas.
The very few of them I sent to publication were accepted so far,
and I should distinguish them at least between: idealized, written and published.

Here it goes.
For now I have made only a list of the unpublished ideas and
did not differentiate the ones I have written about from the ones which
have not received a 'natural language' documentation:
* Decomposition of a (original) sound using any other sound as the basis.
The basis sound should be used in many scales to represent the original
sound reasonably well.
The idea is simply to multiply one sound by the other sample-by-sample
and then sum. This is the scalar multiplication of one sound by the
other, i.e. the magnitude of the projection of one sound into the other.
* A scientific account of the [AirHackTable](http://wiki.nosdigitais.teia.org.br/AirHackTable)
* Meta-sieves: mathematical structures to be mapped to sound.
This idea is very incipient and I don't know how much it makes sense
within the framework proposed by Xenakis.
Meta-sieves are at the moment conceptualized (by me) as any mathematical
structure that filters a given domain: a probabilistic distribution,
a group, a ring, etc.
* [Ideal Ideas](https://github.com/ttm/idealIdeas/raw/master/pensamento.pdf):
a physical model of the mind.
* A very brief account of the [MASS](https://github.com/ttm/dissertacao/raw/master/article/acm/sample-acmsmall.pdf)
framework for describing musical elements in PCM audio.
This document should contain only the equations, algorithms and very brief
explanations.
* A description of the Social Participation Ontologies we developed.
This [technical report](https://github.com/ttm/pnud5/raw/master/latex/produto.pdf)
has directions to find them all.
* A description of the recommendation and classification systems we conceived for social
  participation.
  This [technical report](https://github.com/ttm/pnud3/blob/master/latex/produto.pdf)
  has some notes and algorithms on them.
* A description of the experiments on collection and diffusion of
  information we performed and explained in the last appendix of this
  [doctoral thesis](https://github.com/ttm/thesis/raw/master/thesis-rfabbri.pdf).
* Psychophysical experiments with the MASS framework mentioned above
(maybe with emphasis on the sonic pictures).
* Complex networks gradus ad Parnassum: a tutorial on complex networks
  theory and harnessing.
* The Scientific Style: a very short account on the overall structure of
  scientific articles (consider at least the most often templates).
* Analysis of the Toki Pona language and an exposition of the Vim
  text highlighting implemented.
* The network layout implementations made for [ccNetViz](https://github.com/ttm/ccNetViz/).
* Enhancement on the description and simulation of the Doppler effect by
  considering also the variation of the intensity of the wave.
  (Find out if this is really not yet described in the literature).
* Integral serialism with permutations and algebraic groups (for musical
  composition).
* Vocabulary and Ontology for the MASS framework mentioned above.
* Deepen the concept of the [Anthropological Physics](http://www.academia.edu/10356773/What_are_you_and_I_anthropological_physics_fundamentals_).
* Finish the [analysis of the work by Machado de Assis by text mining](https://sourceforge.net/p/labmacambira/rcpln/ci/master/tree/pln/trabLetras/resumoLetras.pdf?format=raw).
* Describe the process of constructing OWL ontologies from raw data.
This process is very briefly described in this [doctoral thesis](https://github.com/ttm/thesis/raw/master/thesis-rfabbri.pdf).
* Sonic doin: using continuous and intermittent sounds for therapy.
We should use the MASS framework (mentioned above) for this.
* About AA, what it is, what it is not and how it can be harnessed.
