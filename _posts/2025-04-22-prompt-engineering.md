# Advanced Prompt Engineering for Expert LLM Users

## Conceptual Overview of Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering is the art and science of communicating with a generative language model to achieve a desired outcome ([[2312.16171] Principled Instructions Are All You Need for Questioning LLaMA-1/2, GPT-3.5/4](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2312.16171v1.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%9C)) ([26 principles for prompt engineering to increase LLM accuracy 57%](https://codingscape.com/blog/26-principles-for-prompt-engineering-to-increase-llm-accuracy#:~:text=Prompt%20engineering%20is%20the%20technique,375k%20a%20year)). It involves carefully crafting the **input prompt** – the text (and context) we give to an LLM – so that the model produces accurate, relevant, and useful responses. In practice, this means writing instructions and context in a way that leverages the model’s strengths and avoids its weaknesses. The goal is to bridge the gap between what you _want_ and what the model _understands_, guiding it to generate the best possible result for your needs ([26 principles for prompt engineering to increase LLM accuracy 57%](https://codingscape.com/blog/26-principles-for-prompt-engineering-to-increase-llm-accuracy#:~:text=Prompt%20engineering%20is%20the%20technique,375k%20a%20year)). This skill has broad applications: not just writing essays, but also solving math and coding problems, brainstorming, and much more ([26 principles for prompt engineering to increase LLM accuracy 57%](https://codingscape.com/blog/26-principles-for-prompt-engineering-to-increase-llm-accuracy#:~:text=Prompt%20engineering%20is%20the%20technique,375k%20a%20year)). Over time, a set of best practices and key concepts has emerged as crucial for effective prompts ([Prompt Engineering Principles for 2024](https://www.prompthub.us/blog/prompt-engineering-principles-for-2024#:~:text=Now%20that%20prompt%20engineering%20has,reasoning%20and%20%206)).

**Key Prompting Concepts and Principles:**

- **Clarity of Instructions:** Clearly state what you want the model to do. Ambiguous or polite fluff can dilute the instruction – it’s better to be direct and explicit ([Prompt Engineering Principles for 2024](https://www.prompthub.us/blog/prompt-engineering-principles-for-2024#:~:text=Prompt%20Structure%20and%20Clarity%204,shot)) ([10 Advanced Prompt Engineering Techniques for ChatGPT - DevriX](https://devrix.com/tutorial/advanced-prompt-engineering-techniques-for-chatgpt/#:~:text=At%20its%20core%2C%20prompt%20engineering,The%20basic%20principles%20are)). For example, _“List three potential explanations for the observed data”_ is clearer than _“I was wondering if you could maybe tell me a bit about why this might be happening.”_ A well-defined prompt uses precise language and affirmative directives (tell the model what _to do_, not just what _not_ to do) ([Prompt Engineering Principles for 2024](https://www.prompthub.us/blog/prompt-engineering-principles-for-2024#:~:text=%E2%80%8D)) ([Prompt Engineering Principles for 2024](https://www.prompthub.us/blog/prompt-engineering-principles-for-2024#:~:text=Use%20Delimiters)).

- **Context and Background:** Provide any necessary context or background information the model needs to perform the task ([10 Advanced Prompt Engineering Techniques for ChatGPT - DevriX](https://devrix.com/tutorial/advanced-prompt-engineering-techniques-for-chatgpt/#:~:text=1,Constraints%20or%20preferences)). Remember, the model only knows what’s in the prompt (and its training data, which may not cover your specific problem). If you’re asking a physics question, briefly describe the scenario or give the relevant formulas. For a coding task, include the relevant code snippet or error message. The prompt should be _contextually relevant_ to the task at hand ([Prompt Engineering Principles for 2024](https://www.prompthub.us/blog/prompt-engineering-principles-for-2024#:~:text=,Free%20from%20bias)) – don’t assume the model will recall specific details unless you supply them.

- **Role Prompting (Persona):** You can ask the model to _adopt a role or persona_ to guide its style and knowledge. For instance, start with _“You are a senior data scientist...”_ or _“Act as a physics professor explaining to a student...”_. Assigning a role can anchor the model in a certain mindset or expertise ([Prompt Engineering Principles for 2024](https://www.prompthub.us/blog/prompt-engineering-principles-for-2024#:~:text=Content%20and%20Language%20Style%2016,output%20primers%2C%20which%20involve%20concluding)), which often leads to outputs more tailored to that perspective. This is useful across domains: a model “playing the role” of a poet will use more flowery language, whereas one acting as a Python tutor will provide more technical detail.

- **Specificity and Detail:** Be specific about the desired output and constraints. Mention the format, length, or aspects you want the answer to focus on ([10 Advanced Prompt Engineering Techniques for ChatGPT - DevriX](https://devrix.com/tutorial/advanced-prompt-engineering-techniques-for-chatgpt/#:~:text=1,Constraints%20or%20preferences)). For example, _“Provide the answer as a JSON object”_ or _“In one paragraph, compare these two theories.”_ If you need a certain style (e.g. conversational vs. formal), state that. Specific prompts yield more focused answers ([10 Advanced Prompt Engineering Techniques for ChatGPT - DevriX](https://devrix.com/tutorial/advanced-prompt-engineering-techniques-for-chatgpt/#:~:text=At%20its%20core%2C%20prompt%20engineering,The%20basic%20principles%20are)) ([10 Advanced Prompt Engineering Techniques for ChatGPT - DevriX](https://devrix.com/tutorial/advanced-prompt-engineering-techniques-for-chatgpt/#:~:text=1,Constraints%20or%20preferences)). However, avoid _overloading_ the prompt with irrelevant details or overly long instructions – too much information can confuse the model ([10 Advanced Prompt Engineering Techniques for ChatGPT - DevriX](https://devrix.com/tutorial/advanced-prompt-engineering-techniques-for-chatgpt/#:~:text=Keep%20in%20mind%20that%20generative,Finding%20the%20balance%20is%20key)). Finding the balance between too little and too much detail is key ([10 Advanced Prompt Engineering Techniques for ChatGPT - DevriX](https://devrix.com/tutorial/advanced-prompt-engineering-techniques-for-chatgpt/#:~:text=Keep%20in%20mind%20that%20generative,Finding%20the%20balance%20is%20key)).

- **In-Context Examples (Few-Shot Prompting):** Showing the model _examples_ of the task can dramatically improve results ([Prompt Engineering Principles for 2024](https://www.prompthub.us/blog/prompt-engineering-principles-for-2024#:~:text=Specificity%20and%20Information%207%20Implement,7)) ([How to write better prompts for GitHub Copilot - The GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/developer-skills/github/how-to-write-better-prompts-for-github-copilot/#:~:text=3,%E2%9C%8D%EF%B8%8F)). In “few-shot” prompting, you prepend one or more example Q&A pairs or demonstrations to the prompt, so the model can infer the pattern. For instance, to prompt scientific reasoning, you might include a short worked example of a similar physics problem (question + step-by-step solution) before asking it to solve your target problem. Examples help the model understand the format and level of detail expected ([Prompt Engineering Principles for 2024](https://www.prompthub.us/blog/prompt-engineering-principles-for-2024#:~:text=Specificity%20and%20Information%207%20Implement,7)). Even in coding, providing an example of input and desired output can guide the model to produce correct code ([How to write better prompts for GitHub Copilot - The GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/developer-skills/github/how-to-write-better-prompts-for-github-copilot/#:~:text=3,%E2%9C%8D%EF%B8%8F)) ([How to write better prompts for GitHub Copilot - The GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/developer-skills/github/how-to-write-better-prompts-for-github-copilot/#:~:text=It%20generated%20an%20incorrect%20usage,of%20map)). Ensure your examples are relevant and illustrative of the outcome you want.

- **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:** Encourage the model to _think step-by-step_ for complex problems. Including a phrase like “Let’s solve this step by step” or explicitly instructing _“Show your reasoning before giving the final answer”_ can invoke the model’s chain-of-thought mode ([Prompt Engineering Principles for 2024](https://www.prompthub.us/blog/prompt-engineering-principles-for-2024#:~:text=Use%20leading%20words%20like%20writing,%E2%80%9Cthink%20step%20by%20step%E2%80%9D)). This often leads to more logical and correct solutions in math, physics, or any multi-step reasoning task, as the model will lay out intermediate steps ([Prompt Engineering Principles for 2024](https://www.prompthub.us/blog/prompt-engineering-principles-for-2024#:~:text=Use%20leading%20words%20like%20writing,%E2%80%9Cthink%20step%20by%20step%E2%80%9D)). It helps especially in scientific and technical prompts by making the model break down the problem – much like you would do on paper.

- **Structured Prompt Formatting:** How you format the prompt can matter. Clearly delineate different parts of the prompt (instructions, data, examples, etc.). Many prompt engineers use delimiters like triple quotes `"""` or code blocks to isolate sections of input or to indicate where the model’s answer should focus ([Prompt Engineering Principles for 2024](https://www.prompthub.us/blog/prompt-engineering-principles-for-2024#:~:text=The%20best%20advice%20often%20needs,to%20be%20repeated)). For example, you might say: _“Here is the data: `<data table>` Please analyze it...”_ Using bullet points or numbered steps in your prompt can also guide the model to answer in a structured way. A structured prompt is easier for the model to parse than a long, rambling paragraph.

In summary, effective prompts are **concise, explicit, context-rich, and structured**, often with examples to steer the model ([Prompt Engineering Principles for 2024](https://www.prompthub.us/blog/prompt-engineering-principles-for-2024#:~:text=,Free%20from%20bias)). They align with the task and audience (e.g. explaining to a 5-year-old vs. to an expert) and avoid ambiguity. A recent study distilled 26 prompt design principles along these lines – emphasizing clarity, contextual relevance, task alignment, use of examples, and unbiased language ([Prompt Engineering Principles for 2024](https://www.prompthub.us/blog/prompt-engineering-principles-for-2024#:~:text=The%20principles%20are%20broken%20down,Complex%20Tasks%20and%20Coding%20Prompts)). By adhering to these principles, you tap into more of the model’s capability: larger LLMs especially respond well to precise, well-crafted directives ([[2312.16171] Principled Instructions Are All You Need for Questioning LLaMA-1/2, GPT-3.5/4](https://ar5iv.org/pdf/2312.16171v1.pdf#:~:text=In%20this%20work%2C%20we%20present,more%20effectively%20the%20model%20performs)). Prompt engineering is an iterative, experimental process at its core – even experts refine and tweak prompts multiple times to get the best result. Next, we’ll explore specific techniques and examples in different domains, reflecting the needs of scientific research, coding, creative writing, and image generation.

## Prompt Design Techniques by Domain

Different problem domains benefit from different prompt strategies. An experienced user like you might switch between asking a model to derive a physics formula, debug code, or draft a poem. The fundamental concepts remain the same, but how you apply them can vary. Below is a structured guide to prompt techniques tailored to four domains: scientific research, coding, creative writing, and image generation.

### Scientific Research & Computational Tasks

For applied science, physics, data analysis, and mathematical problem-solving, prompts should leverage the model’s reasoning abilities and factual knowledge while minimizing confusion and errors. Key techniques include:

- **State the Problem and Context Clearly:** Begin by clearly stating the scientific question or task. Include any context a domain expert would consider. For example: _“You are a physics researcher. Explain how to derive the uncertainty principle starting from wave-particle duality.”_ If the task involves data or an equation, provide those explicitly in the prompt. Including relevant details (constants, data values, assumptions) will ground the model in the specifics of the problem.

- **Ask for Step-by-Step Reasoning:** As noted, prompting the model to show its work is vital for complex calculations or logical reasoning ([Prompt Engineering Principles for 2024](https://www.prompthub.us/blog/prompt-engineering-principles-for-2024#:~:text=Use%20leading%20words%20like%20writing,%E2%80%9Cthink%20step%20by%20step%E2%80%9D)). You might say, _“Solve this step by step:”_ or _“First, outline the approach, then compute the result.”_ This reduces the chance of the model jumping to a wrong answer. In physics or math, it’s often useful to have the model explain its reasoning – not only do you get the answer, but you also get a derivation or explanation you can examine.

- **Use Few-Shot Examples for Format:** If you want a specific format (e.g., a formal proof, or a lab report style answer), provide a short example in the prompt. _Few-shot example:_ “**Q:** _Calculate the acceleration of an object given mass and force._ **A:** _First, I recall Newton’s second law... [derivation] ... The acceleration is 5 m/s²._” Then ask your actual question in a similar Q/A format. This teaches the model the style of response you expect ([Prompt Engineering Principles for 2024](https://www.prompthub.us/blog/prompt-engineering-principles-for-2024#:~:text=Specificity%20and%20Information%207%20Implement,7)).

- **Instruct the Model to Double-Check or Verify:** Models sometimes make arithmetic or logical errors. You can preempt this by adding _“Check if your answer is reasonable”_ or _“Explain why the result makes sense.”_ This encourages the model to self-critique its answer, potentially catching mistakes. For example, _“Finally, verify if the units and magnitude of the result are appropriate for a physical scenario.”_ Such instructions can harness the model’s ability to reflect on its output.

- **Specify Output Requirements:** If you need the answer in a specific form – say, a numerical value with units, a formatted table, or an equation – mention that. _“Give the answer as a simplified equation.”_ In computational tasks, you might even ask for pseudocode or an algorithm outline if that’s useful. Being specific reduces ambiguity about what the final output should look like.

- **Leverage the Model for Insight, Not Factual Recall:** Remember that while LLMs have read a lot of scientific literature, they might not reliably recall niche facts or latest research specifics. Use them more for reasoning, explaining concepts, or suggesting hypotheses. For factual questions (e.g., _“What’s the measured value of the Hubble constant?”_), it’s safer to provide the fact (if you know it) and ask the model to interpret or use it, rather than expecting the model to know the latest precise value. When you must query facts, consider adding _“If unsure, say you are not sure”_ to discourage hallucination.

- **Domain-Specific Tone or Depth:** You can tune the complexity of the explanation by specifying the audience. For example, _“Explain like I’m a college freshman physics major”_ vs _“Explain in the style of a research seminar for physicists.”_ This helps the model adjust the level of detail and jargon. Integrating the _intended audience_ or level of expertise into the prompt is a proven strategy for aligning the response to the right depth ([Prompt Engineering Principles for 2024](https://www.prompthub.us/blog/prompt-engineering-principles-for-2024#:~:text=to%20add%20phrases%20like%20%E2%80%9Cplease%E2%80%9D%2C,or%20a%20deeper%20understanding%20of)).

By combining these techniques, you can tackle tasks like deriving equations, analyzing experimental results, summarizing research papers, or performing statistical reasoning. For instance, a prompt might look like: _“You are a computational physics expert. The task is to estimate the error in a Monte Carlo simulation result. First, outline the factors contributing to error (such as sample size and random seed). Then suggest at least two methods to quantify the uncertainty. Finally, conclude with which method is more robust and why.”_ A prompt like this gives context, asks for stepwise reasoning, and sets clear expectations for the format of the answer.

### Coding and Technical Problem-Solving

When using LLMs as coding assistants (e.g. with GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT for coding), the prompts should provide enough programming context and precise instructions to guide code generation or debugging. As an expert developer, you can harness prompt engineering to significantly improve code-related outputs:

- **Set the Stage with Context:** Always let the model know _what you’re trying to build or solve_. If starting from scratch, describe the goal: _“Create a Python function that...”_ or _“We need a script to... [task].”_ If you have an existing codebase, include relevant code or a description of it. For example, _“Given the following function (provide code), optimize it for speed.”_ Providing a high-level goal or context primes the model with the “big picture” ([How to write better prompts for GitHub Copilot - The GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/developer-skills/github/how-to-write-better-prompts-for-github-copilot/#:~:text=1,level%20goal.%20%EF%B8%8F)), which is especially important if no code is given yet.

- **Break Down Complex Tasks:** Don’t ask for an entire complex program in one go. Instead, break the problem into smaller sub-tasks and tackle them one by one ([Prompt Engineering Principles for 2024](https://www.prompthub.us/blog/prompt-engineering-principles-for-2024#:~:text=Prompt%20Structure%20and%20Clarity%202,7)) ([How to write better prompts for GitHub Copilot - The GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/developer-skills/github/how-to-write-better-prompts-for-github-copilot/#:~:text=Once%20you%20communicate%20your%20main,dish%20you%20want%20to%20make)). For instance, rather than saying “Write a program to simulate solar system orbits,” you might prompt step-by-step: _“First, write a class for a Planet with properties mass, position, velocity.”_ After it’s done, _“Now write a function to update positions using Newton’s laws.”_ This stepwise prompting (a form of chain-of-thought for coding) helps maintain focus and accuracy ([How to write better prompts for GitHub Copilot - The GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/developer-skills/github/how-to-write-better-prompts-for-github-copilot/#:~:text=Once%20you%20communicate%20your%20main,dish%20you%20want%20to%20make)). It also lets you review and correct each piece before moving on, much like an interactive pair-programming session.

- **Be Specific in Your Ask:** The more specific the prompt, the more relevant the code. Include details like the programming language, libraries to use or avoid, and desired output format. For example: _“Using Python and NumPy, generate a 1000-sample random dataset drawn from a normal distribution with mean 0 and std 1, and return the mean of the dataset.”_ If you need a certain approach (e.g., a list comprehension, or using recursion), mention it. This specificity prevents the model from guessing or using unwanted techniques ([Best practices for using GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/using-github-copilot/best-practices-for-using-github-copilot#:~:text=Best%20practices%20for%20using%20GitHub,input%20data%2C%20outputs%2C%20and)) ([10 Advanced Prompt Engineering Techniques for ChatGPT - DevriX](https://devrix.com/tutorial/advanced-prompt-engineering-techniques-for-chatgpt/#:~:text=At%20its%20core%2C%20prompt%20engineering,The%20basic%20principles%20are)).

- **Provide Examples of Inputs/Outputs:** For functions or algorithms, it helps to show an example. _“For instance, if input is X, the output should be Y.”_ By demonstrating the desired behavior, you guide the model to produce code that achieves that result ([How to write better prompts for GitHub Copilot - The GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/developer-skills/github/how-to-write-better-prompts-for-github-copilot/#:~:text=3,%E2%9C%8D%EF%B8%8F)). In a bug-fix scenario, you might show the erroneous input and output (or error message), and then ask for a fix. Example: _“Here’s a sample input and the wrong output it produces... Please fix the code so that the output becomes ... [correct output].”_ This way, the model knows exactly what outcome you’re aiming for.

- **Use Proper Formatting and Delimiters:** When prompting for code, format your prompt to clearly separate code from instructions. You can enclose code snippets in triple backticks (\`\`\`) to signal to the model that this is code context. For example: _“Here is the function:\n`python\n...code...\n`\nIt’s not producing the expected result. Debug this function.”_ The model will then see the code distinctly. Also, explicitly ask for the answer in a markdown code block (especially when using ChatGPT) to ensure it outputs well-formatted code. E.g. _“Provide the corrected code only, inside one `python` block.”_

- **Encourage Explanations (when needed):** If you’re learning or want to verify the solution, ask for a brief explanation of the code. _“Give the code and then explain your changes in comments.”_ This can help with understanding. Conversely, if you only want code, state that clearly to avoid extra commentary. For instance, _“Just output the final code, without any additional text.”_ Clarity here prevents the model from giving you a verbose answer when you only want a snippet.

- **Iterate and Refine:** Just like coding in real life, you might need to iterate. If the first answer isn’t perfect, refine your prompt. You can say, _“That’s close, but I actually need it to handle negative inputs too.”_ The model can then adjust the code. With Copilot or chat-based coding, this interactive refinement is expected. One powerful approach is to have the model suggest tests: _“Write a few unit tests for the function above.”_ This not only gives you tests but also implicitly checks if the code works. If a test fails, that’s a cue to refine the prompt or the code further.

- **Leverage Few-Shot for Style Guides:** If you have a particular coding style or format (docstrings, comment style, etc.), show an example of that. For instance: _“Here is how I usually format my function comments: ... Now document the following function in a similar style.”_ The model can mimic the style in its output.

By using these techniques, you can get help writing functions, debugging errors, generating documentation, or even designing algorithms. A sample prompt might be: _“You are an expert C++ developer. I have a performance issue.\n`cpp\n// Code snippet of a loop\n`\nThis loop is slow for large inputs. Optimize this code for better performance, and explain the optimization.”_ This prompt sets a role, provides context (code), specifies the task (optimize), and asks for an explanation. The result should be a refined code snippet along with reasoning. Remember, models like ChatGPT and Copilot have read lots of code – the more you can precisely communicate your problem and goals, the more they can help.

### Creative Writing (Poetry, Spiritual Texts, Stories)

When it comes to creative tasks – such as composing poetry, prayers, or narrative content – prompt engineering focuses on guiding the style, tone, and creative boundaries of the output, while leaving room for the model’s imagination. Here are techniques to channel the model’s creativity:

- **Establish a Creative Scenario or Persona:** Kick off the prompt by setting a scene or adopting a persona that fits the creative task. _“Imagine you are a 19th-century poet laureate writing about the night sky.”_ or _“You are an ancient sage composing a morning prayer.”_ This primes the model with a narrative voice or perspective, which can make the output more authentic and rich in that style.

- **Specify Tone, Mood, and Style:** Clearly indicate the desired tone (joyful, melancholic, reverent, etc.), form (sonnet, free verse, haiku, liturgy), or any stylistic devices you want. For a poem you might say: _“Write a solemn, rhythmic prayer in free verse that feels hopeful.”_ For a story: _“Tell a whimsical fairy tale in the style of a bedtime story, with a moral at the end.”_ Including such descriptors guides the model’s creative choices – models are quite adept at mimicking styles when instructed (even specific authors or texts, though use that carefully to avoid mere pastiche).

- **Provide Imagery or Themes:** Give the model some thematic anchors or imagery to work with. For example: _“Include references to stars and the ocean to symbolize infinity.”_ or _“The poem should invoke feelings of curiosity and awe, mentioning scientific marvels like galaxies or atoms.”_ By feeding a few vivid details or metaphors, you spark the model to continue in that vein. This is especially useful for poetry and prayers, where rich imagery is key.

- **Use Few-Shot Examples for Format or Rhyme:** If you want a very specific format (say a limerick, or a Shakespearean sonnet with a particular rhyme scheme), you can show an example or part of one. For instance: _“Here is a haiku example:\n‘An old silent pond…’\nNow write a haiku about a city at dawn.”_ The model sees the structure and can emulate it. You can even provide a first line or a title to set direction. E.g., _“Title: The Solace of Dawn\n\nWrite a poem with this title, and start the first line with ‘In quiet light…’”_ – the model will continue from that hint, maintaining the style.

- **Balance Constraints with Freedom:** In creative prompting, it’s important to set some constraints (to avoid generic output) but not so many that the model has no room to be inventive. For example, specifying a rhyme scheme and theme is fine, but micromanaging every line’s content might lead to a stiff result. An expert tip is to guide the high-level structure and let the model fill in the rest. _“Write four stanzas about the seasons, one stanza for each season, with a consistent ABAB rhyme scheme. The tone should progress from joyful (spring) to serene (winter).”_ – This gives a clear structure, yet the model will creatively decide the details within those bounds.

- **Iterate and Refine the Output:** Creativity often benefits from iteration. You can ask for multiple options and then refine. For instance: _“Give me two different metaphors for the concept of time in poetic form.”_ If the first attempt isn’t striking enough, you might then prompt: _“The second metaphor is interesting – can you expand that into a longer poem, making it more emotional?”_ Use the conversation to refine style: _“Make it more vivid,”_ or _“Use simpler language,”_ or _“Add an element of spirituality.”_ The model can adjust the draft accordingly. This iterative creative process can yield a better final piece.

- **Ensure Factual or Thematic Consistency:** If you’re generating content like a Wikipedia-style article or a factual story (part of content creation), you’ll want the _neutral tone_ and _accuracy_. In such cases, instruct the model accordingly: _“Write an encyclopedic entry on Quantum Entanglement. Use a neutral, informative tone and include definitions of key terms. Do not include any speculative or debunked claims.”_ This is more on the content creation side than pure creative writing, but it’s worth noting since you mentioned Wikipedia articles. For these, the prompt should emphasize structured output (introduction, sections, conclusion) and factuality. You might even say, _“Cite any key facts with a source if possible”_ – though the model may or may not accurately generate citations, it signals to stick to factual information.

In creative endeavors, the unexpected can be part of the charm. But as an experienced user, you have tools to shape that creativity. For example, a complete prompt for a poem might be: _“You are a poet and a physicist combined. Write a thoughtful poem (free verse) about the dual nature of light (wave and particle). The tone should be contemplative and awe-inspired. Include at least one metaphor relating this duality to everyday life, and one reference to a scientific discovery (like Einstein or Newton).”_ This prompt sets role, topic, tone, and even a content requirement, yet still gives the model freedom to craft the actual lines. The resulting poem should be both scientifically flavored and emotionally resonant, suited to a reader with a physics background.

### Image Generation & Artistic Exploration

Prompting image-generating models (like DALL·E, Midjourney, or Stable Diffusion) is a bit different from text prompts, but many principles overlap. You’re describing the image you want to see, and the model “draws” it. To get high-quality, specific images, consider these prompt engineering techniques:

- **Be Descriptive and Paint a Mental Picture:** Use natural, vivid language to describe the scene or subject, rather than just a list of keywords ([How to write AI image prompts - From basic to pro [2024]](https://letsenhance.io/blog/article/ai-text-prompt-guide/#:~:text=Takeaways)). For example, _“A curious red fox exploring a misty autumn forest at dawn”_ is better than _“red fox, forest, dawn”_ ([How to write AI image prompts - From basic to pro [2024]](https://letsenhance.io/blog/article/ai-text-prompt-guide/#:~:text=Takeaways)). Envision the image in your mind and describe the key elements and atmosphere. Think in terms of the five senses and descriptive adjectives – this helps the model capture the details.

- **Include Subject, Environment, and Style:** A useful formula for image prompts is **[Subject] + [Context/Environment] + [Style/Modifiers]** ([How to write AI image prompts - From basic to pro [2024]](https://letsenhance.io/blog/article/ai-text-prompt-guide/#:~:text=,prompt%20structure)). For instance: _“**Subject:** A medieval castle on a hill, **Environment:** under a stormy night sky with lightning, **Style:** digital art illustration, highly detailed, dramatic lighting.”_ This covers what the main focus is, where or how it is situated, and the artistic style. Key elements to consider mentioning are: **setting** (place, background), **lighting** (e.g. soft glow, harsh shadows, golden hour), **colors** (vibrant neon, muted pastel), **mood** (somber, cheerful, mysterious), and **art style** (photorealistic, cartoon, oil painting, pixel art, etc.) ([How to write AI image prompts - From basic to pro [2024]](https://letsenhance.io/blog/article/ai-text-prompt-guide/#:~:text=,up%20to%2050)). The more you specify these, the closer the image will align with your vision ([How to write AI image prompts - From basic to pro [2024]](https://letsenhance.io/blog/article/ai-text-prompt-guide/#:~:text=,up%20to%2050)).

- **Leverage Style References and Medium:** If you want a particular artistic style, you can reference it. For example, _“in the style of Van Gogh”_ or _“a watercolor painting”_ or _“cinematic 35mm photograph”_. These cues tell the model _how_ to generate the image. Models have learned a wide range of art styles and mediums, so invoking them can drastically change the output’s appearance. Combining multiple style cues is also possible (e.g. _“cyberpunk art, inspired by Studio Ghibli”_). As an advanced user, you might know each model has its own syntax (Midjourney uses phrases freely; Stable Diffusion might use weights or terms like _–ar 16:9_ for aspect ratio). Tailor your prompt to the platform’s conventions.

- **Specify Aspect Ratio or Composition if Needed:** For instance, if you want a landscape orientation or a close-up portrait, say so: _“wide angle shot”_, _“portrait orientation headshot”_, _“top-down view”_, etc. Composition keywords like _“foreground”_, _“background”_, _“centered”_, _“panoramic”_ help the model layout the scene. Some image generators let you explicitly set aspect ratio (like `--ar 16:9` in Midjourney) – use these features if available, or include the desired aspect in words (e.g. “a wide panorama of…”).

- **Use Negative Prompts or Exclusions (if supported):** Advanced image models (especially Stable Diffusion-based ones) allow _negative prompting_ – specifying what you **do not** want. For example: _“[Positive description]. **Negative:** no text, no watermark, no blur.”_ This can help eliminate common artifacts or unwanted elements. If the platform supports a `--no` parameter or similar, use it to list things to avoid (like _“--no people”_ if you want an empty landscape with no figures).

- **Experiment with Prompt Length and Variations:** Sometimes a short prompt works (especially if you’re looking for broader interpretations), and sometimes a longer, very detailed prompt works better. It can depend on the model. As a practice, you could try a one-sentence description versus a five-sentence description and see which yields a closer result to what you imagined ([How to write AI image prompts - From basic to pro [2024]](https://letsenhance.io/blog/article/ai-text-prompt-guide/#:~:text=%2A%20Leverage%20platform,best%20for%20each%20AI%20tool)). Don’t hesitate to re-run the generation with tweaks: change a word, add a detail, or remove something to see how it impacts the image. For instance, adding _“high contrast”_ or _“ultrarealistic”_ might sharpen the output, whereas adding _“childlike crayon drawing”_ would do the opposite.

- **Use Iterative Feedback:** Similar to text, you can iteratively refine an image prompt. If the first image is almost right but not quite (maybe the fox was too small in the image, or the colors were off), adjust the prompt: _“Make the fox larger in frame and emphasize the golden morning light.”_ Some platforms allow interactive adjustments or re-rolling with changes. Over a few iterations, you can hone in on the exact image style you want. Experienced prompters often generate multiple images with slightly varied prompts and then pick or even composite the best results.

Remember that image models interpret language in their own way – it’s often a mix of art and trial-and-error to get a perfect image. By providing a clear, vivid description and specifying crucial details, you significantly increase your chances of getting a satisfying result ([How to write AI image prompts - From basic to pro [2024]](https://letsenhance.io/blog/article/ai-text-prompt-guide/#:~:text=Takeaways)). For example, an effective prompt might be: _“A **majestic Bengal tiger** with vibrant orange fur, **stalking through a lush tropical rainforest** dappled with sunlight, **digital painting**. Ultra-detailed, realistic textures, **dramatic lighting** with rays of sun.”_ This prompt hits subject (tiger), environment (rainforest, sunlight), and style (digital painting, ultra-detailed, dramatic lighting), and should produce a striking image. Each attribute you add or remove will influence the generation, so this domain really rewards iterative experimentation.

## Prompt Models and Templates by Domain

Below is a curated collection of prompt templates and examples for each domain. These are starting points or patterns you can adapt to your needs. Replace the placeholders (in brackets) with your specific topic, data, or requirements. Each template demonstrates the ideas from the previous section in a ready-to-use format.

What are possible causes of this error, and how can I fix it?”_ – (Engages the model in diagnosing an error. The model can list reasons for the error and potential fixes, like a rubber-duck debugging aide.)

- **Unit Test Generator:** _“Given the following function, write a set of unit tests for it:\n`[function code]`\nUse **[testing framework, e.g. PyTest/JUnit]** and cover typical cases and edge cases.”_ – (Produces unit tests, ensuring the function’s behavior is checked for various inputs. This is useful both to verify code and to implicitly understand its intended behavior.)

### Creative & Content Writing Templates

- **Poem or Songwriter:** _“Write a **[type of poem/song]** about **[topic]**. The tone should be **[tone, e.g. reflective and serene]**. Include imagery involving **[element, e.g. stars, rivers]**, and use a **[rhyme scheme or meter if any, e.g. AABB rhyme]**.”_ – (Creates a poem or song with specific mood and imagery. By specifying form and content elements, you guide the creative output.)

- **Story Narration:** _“Tell a **[genre, e.g. science fiction]** short story about **[brief premise]**. It should include a protagonist who **[character detail]** and a conflict involving **[conflict].** Make sure the story has a clear beginning, middle, and end, and ends on a **[tone, e.g. hopeful]** note.”_ – (Generates a structured story. This template ensures the story isn’t just open-ended by explicitly asking for a structure and an ending tone.)

- **Prayer or Inspirational Text:** _“Compose a prayer for **[occasion or purpose, e.g. starting a scientific endeavor]**. It should be **[tone, e.g. uplifting and humble]**, mention **[themes or values, e.g. wisdom, patience]**, and be addressed to **[deity/universe or none]** in a way that is inclusive.”_ – (Produces a spiritual or meditative text tailored to a theme, controlling tone and inclusivity as needed.)

- **Encyclopedia/Wikipedia Entry:** _“Write a Wikipedia-style article on **[subject]**. Start with a one-sentence definition, then an overview in a few sentences. Include sections on **[History]**, **[Applications]**, and **[Significance]**. Use a neutral, informative tone and do not include any unverifiable information or personal opinion.”_ – (Generates a structured factual article. This template emphasizes neutrality and structure, crucial for content meant to resemble Wikipedia. It guards against hallucination by warning against unverifiable info, though one should still fact-check the output.)

- **Dialogue or Roleplay Scene:** _“Imagine a conversation between **[personA]** and **[personB]** about **[topic]**. Write their dialogue in a script format. PersonA is **[character traits or role]** and PersonB is **[another role]**. Ensure the conversation stays focused on **[the theme]** and remains **[tone, e.g. friendly debate]**.”_ – (Useful for generating dialogue or scripts, this prompt sets roles and topic so the model produces a coherent conversation.)

- **Listicle/Idea List:** _“Give me a list of **[number]** creative ideas for **[task or theme]**. Each idea should be one sentence or bullet, and should incorporate **[certain element].**”_ – (Generates a brainstorm-style list. For example, “10 experiment ideas for a physics class using household items.” This uses the model’s creativity in a constrained list format.)

### Image Prompt Templates

- **Object & Setting (Basic):** _“A **[main subject]** in **[setting]** – **[style]**.”_ – e.g., _“A **lonely astronaut** on the **surface of Mars at sunset** – **digital art illustration**.”_ (Subject + setting + style. A simple template to cover the basics for an image.)

- **Detailed Scene Description:** _“**[Subject]** **[action or situation]** **[environment],** **[time of day/weather]**. **Style:** **[art style/medium]**, **[mood]**, **[lighting].**”_ – e.g., _“**Ancient tree** standing **alone on a cliff, roots entwined with the rock,** **sunset sky** in the background. **Style:** **matte painting**, **mystical and tranquil**, **soft golden lighting**.”_ (This template breaks out multiple aspects of the scene to plug in details.)

- **Character Concept Art:** _“Character concept art of **[describe character]**, wearing **[clothing/armor style]**, in **[pose or action]**. **Background:** **[simple/complex background description].** **Art style:** **[e.g. anime, realistic, comic book].**”_ – e.g., _“Character concept art of **a cyberpunk detective**, wearing **a trench coat with neon circuitry**, **standing under a futuristic streetlight in rain**. **Background:** blurry city skyline. **Art style:** gritty graphic novel illustration.”_ (Useful for generating character designs with specific attire and ambiance.)

- **Interior/Architecture Design:** _“A **[style]** interior of a **[type of room/place]**. **Features:** **[notable features like furniture, materials]**. **Lighting:** **[lighting description]**. **Mood/Atmosphere:** **[cozy, stark, etc.]**”_ – e.g., _“A **minimalist Japanese-style interior of a tea room**. **Features:** low table, tatami mats, shoji screens, a bonsai in the corner. **Lighting:** soft natural light from a paper lantern. **Mood:** tranquil and warm.”_ (For architectural or interior design visualizations, specifying style and features yields more targeted images.)

- **Artistic Style Remix:** _“**[Subject or scene]** in the style of **[artist/era]** with **[additional stylistic elements]**.”_ – e.g., _“**A bustling 21st century cityscape** in the style of **Vincent van Gogh**, with swirling night skies and vibrant brushstrokes.”_ (This prompt explicitly asks for a style transfer – applying a known artist’s style to a new scene. It’s a powerful way to get creative outputs.)

- **Abstract/Conceptual Prompt:** _“An abstract representation of **[concept]**, **[additional detail or metaphor]**, **[dominant colors or shapes]** – **[medium or style]**.”_ – e.g., _“An abstract representation of **quantum entanglement**, **twin spirals of energy linked across space**, in **shades of blue and gold** – **digital art**.”_ (Generates conceptual art from an idea, which can be useful for visualizing themes or intangible concepts.)

Each of these templates can be adjusted or combined as needed. They serve as scaffolding – you fill in the specifics of your scenario. As you refine them for your own use, you’ll develop a library of go-to prompts for different situations. Remember that templates are just starting points; feel free to experiment by adding or removing details to see how the model’s output changes.

## Practical Exercises for Prompt Mastery

To truly refine your prompt engineering skills, practice is essential. Below are some hands-on exercises. For each exercise, try the task with an initial prompt, observe the output, and then iteratively refine your prompt to improve the result. The key is to experiment and **self-evaluate**: analyze how each change in your prompt affects the model’s response.

1. **Scientific Prompt Refinement:** Choose a complex physics or math problem you know the answer to (e.g., deriving a formula or explaining a concept). **Step 1:** Prompt the model with the question in a basic way (e.g. _“What is the derivation of ...?”_). Examine the output for correctness and clarity. **Step 2:** Now refine the prompt by adding instructions to show reasoning or a specific role – e.g., _“You are a physics professor, explain step by step how to derive ...”_. Compare the new output: Is it more detailed or accurate? **Step 3:** If the answer is still lacking, add more context or an example. For instance, provide a relevant formula or boundary condition in the prompt. Iterate until the model’s solution is thorough. This exercise will highlight how adding context and guidance (step-by-step instructions, roles, info) improves scientific answers.

2. **Coding Debugging Challenge:** Take a piece of code with a known bug or write a short buggy snippet. **Step 1:** Ask the model plainly to “fix the bug in this code” with the code provided. See what it does. **Step 2:** Next, prompt with more structure: describe what the code is supposed to do, include the error message, or explicitly ask for an explanation of the fix. For example, _“This Python function is supposed to sort a list but it’s not working. Here’s the code... What’s wrong and how can we fix it?”_. Compare the responses. Does the more specific prompt yield a clearer diagnosis or correct fix? **Step 3:** If the model’s fix isn’t quite right, refine by pointing out the part of code that might be problematic or asking it to consider a particular test case. This iterative debugging exercise will show how a well-crafted prompt can turn an AI into a helpful pair programmer.

3. **Creative Writing Style Experiment:** Prompt the model to write a short piece (a poem, a prayer, or a paragraph of prose) on a topic of your choice in two different ways. **Attempt A:** a very minimal prompt, e.g. _“Write a poem about time.”_ Save the output. **Attempt B:** a detailed prompt that specifies style, tone, or form, e.g. _“Write a contemplative free-verse poem about the passage of time, mentioning clocks and rivers, in a tone similar to Walt Whitman.”_ Compare the two outputs. How did the style and quality change? Now take the output from attempt B and identify something to improve – maybe the imagery could be stronger or the language simpler. **Refine:** tweak the prompt or follow up with _“Now make it more metaphorical and add a hopeful ending.”_ Observe how the model adapts. Through this, you practice guiding the model’s creativity and see the impact of specific stylistic instructions.

4. **Image Prompt Iteration:** If you have access to an image generation model, practice with a simple scene. **Round 1:** Write a basic prompt like _“A robot in a field.”_ Observe the result – note aspects you like or want to change. **Round 2:** Refine the prompt by adding details: _“A friendly blue robot standing in a sunflower field at sunrise, digital painting.”_ Generate again and see how it differs. **Round 3:** Add or adjust one more element, perhaps style or composition: _“... in the style of Pixar, wide angle shot.”_ Examine the image. This exercise demonstrates how adding **incremental details** (color, environment, style references, etc.) changes the output. It’s a safe sandbox for learning how image models respond to language. No coding needed – just your imagination and iterative tweaking.

After each exercise, reflect on the outputs. Ask yourself: _Did the change I made to the prompt do what I expected?_ If not, why might that be? Sometimes an unexpected output teaches you something new about how the model interprets prompts. Over time, this trial-and-error builds an intuition for prompt engineering. Keep notes on what phrasing or strategies work best for different scenarios – you’re essentially building your personal prompt playbook through these exercises.

## Understanding LLM Behavior and Avoiding Common Pitfalls

Even with solid prompts, it’s important to understand how LLMs “think” and where things can go wrong. Large language models are powerful, but they have quirks due to how they are built (predicting text based on patterns in training data). Here are some common pitfalls and tips to avoid them:

- **Ambiguity in Prompts:** If your prompt is open to multiple interpretations, the model might pick one arbitrarily – and not the one you intended. For example, _“Write about the significance of the graph”_ is vague: which graph? what significance? To avoid this, **remove ambiguity** by providing details: _“Write a paragraph on why the graph of experiment X shows a plateau after 5 seconds”_. Always ask yourself if a prompt could be misunderstood. If yes, rephrase to be more specific or add context. The more unambiguous your instructions, the more reliably the model will deliver the intended output.

- **Under-Specification (Too Little Guidance):** A very short or high-level prompt might lead to a generic or unfocused answer ([10 Advanced Prompt Engineering Techniques for ChatGPT - DevriX](https://devrix.com/tutorial/advanced-prompt-engineering-techniques-for-chatgpt/#:~:text=Keep%20in%20mind%20that%20generative,Finding%20the%20balance%20is%20key)). For instance, asking _“Explain quantum mechanics.”_ will yield an explanation, but it may not be at the depth or angle you need. Models do have default ways to answer common queries (often broadly and safely), which might not match your specific need. The solution is to **provide additional specificity**: _“Explain quantum mechanics to a high-school student using a real-world analogy, in 3 paragraphs.”_ By specifying audience, approach, or format, you narrow down the task for the model, yielding a more useful answer. Think of it as painting a target for the model to hit, rather than saying “shoot anywhere.”

- **Over-Specification or Conflicting Instructions:** On the flip side, giving too many instructions or including constraints that conflict can confuse the model. If you cram multiple tasks into one prompt (e.g. “Explain this code and write a poem about it”), the model might do one task and ignore the other, or do both poorly. Also, if you say _“be concise”_ and _“provide lots of detail”_ in the same prompt, the model has to guess what you really want. To avoid this, ensure your prompt’s requirements are **clear and consistent**. If a task is naturally multi-part, consider breaking it into sequential prompts. If you need both an explanation and a creative take, do them one at a time or clearly separate the request: _“First, explain the code. Then, in a separate section, give a fun analogy.”_ Using delimiters or explicitly numbered tasks can help the model organize its response without confusion.

- **Hallucinations (Fabricated Information):** LLMs sometimes confidently output information that is incorrect or completely made-up – this is known as a _hallucination_. It happens because the model is trained to produce plausible-sounding text, not to verify facts. If a prompt asks for specific information the model doesn’t truly “know” (like an obscure statistic or a source citation), it may just invent something that looks right. To combat this, **provide factual grounding** in the prompt whenever possible. For example, instead of asking _“What is the current population of X?”_ (which the model might not know or might guess), you can supply that info: _“Given that the population of X is 3.5 million (2020 estimate), what does this imply for ...”_. If you can’t provide the fact, consider phrasing the prompt to **ask for an explanation or analysis** rather than a factual recall (_“Explain the factors affecting the population growth of X”_), or instruct the model to cite sources and **admit uncertainty if unsure**. You might say: _“If you don’t know the exact figure, do not invent one.”_ However, note that models might still output something – they are programmed to be helpful – so always double-check critical facts. For important or sensitive outputs, verification outside the model is essential ([26 principles for prompt engineering to increase LLM accuracy 57%](https://codingscape.com/blog/26-principles-for-prompt-engineering-to-increase-llm-accuracy#:~:text=Decreasing%20hallucinations%20in%20LLMs%20is,is%20by%20designing%20better%20prompts)).

- **Bias and Tone Issues:** The model’s responses can sometimes inadvertently reflect biases or unwanted tones present in its training data. For a highly experienced user, this might show up subtly – perhaps an answer that assumes a certain cultural context or an explanation that is skewed. To avoid this, be mindful in your prompt if neutrality or a specific perspective is needed. You can explicitly instruct, _“Ensure the answer is unbiased and free of stereotypes”_ ([Prompt Engineering Principles for 2024](https://www.prompthub.us/blog/prompt-engineering-principles-for-2024#:~:text=Prompt%20Structure%20and%20Clarity%2012,7)). Role prompting can also control tone to an extent (like telling it to respond as a neutral observer, or conversely, as an advocate for a certain viewpoint if that’s desired in context). If you see bias in an output, you can correct it by refining the prompt or asking the model to reconsider with a statement like _“That answer may reflect a bias. Can you clarify or provide a more balanced view?”_ Modern LLMs are tuned to adjust if the user points out potential bias or harmful content.

- **Failure to Follow Format:** Sometimes the model’s output doesn’t follow the format you requested. This could be due to the prompt not emphasizing the format enough, or the model picking up some other pattern. If this happens, make your format instructions more prominent. For example, **use bullet points** or say _“Answer in the form of a bulleted list:”_ at the end of the prompt if you want bullets. If it still diverges, you might need to break the prompt or use a simpler instruction. Also, ensure that your own prompt wording doesn’t accidentally lead it astray. If you asked for a JSON output but included a lot of commentary, try a more minimal prompt focused only on the JSON requirement. In some cases, showing a tiny _example output format_ (like a template) in the prompt can lock the model to the desired format.

- **Understanding Model Limits:** Finally, as an advanced user, keep in mind the inherent limits of LLMs. They don’t truly “understand” the world – they generate text that statistically matches the kind of responses seen in training. This means:
  - They might not do complex math reliably (unless prompted to do it stepwise) – always verify calculations.
  - They have a fixed cutoff of training knowledge. If you ask about very recent events or discoveries post-cutoff, they might not know, or worse, they’ll hallucinate an answer that sounds plausible. For cutting-edge topics, provide context or expect to fill in the gaps.
  - They strive to please the user. If your prompt implicitly demands an answer even to an impossible question, the model might conjure something up rather than say “I don’t know.” You can encourage honesty by allowing uncertainty in your prompt (e.g., _“If the information is not available, it’s okay to say so.”_).

By being aware of these behaviors, you can adjust your prompting strategy proactively. For example, if you have a prompt that requires factual accuracy (like drafting a Wikipedia paragraph), you now know to feed it verified data upfront or keep the scope limited, and to carefully review the output for errors. If you notice the model going off on a tangent, you likely need to tighten the prompt or use shorter prompts in a sequence (perhaps use a chain of smaller prompts to stay on track ([Chain complex prompts for stronger performance - Anthropic API](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/chain-prompts#:~:text=Chain%20complex%20prompts%20for%20stronger,When%20to%20chain%20prompts))).

In summary, **prompt engineering is as much about managing the conversation with the AI as it is about writing the initial prompt**. If the output is not what you wanted, it’s an opportunity to refine your prompt and try again – not a failure. Even experts rarely get the perfect answer on the first try; they succeed by iterating and understanding the model’s hints. Each “mistake” the model makes is telling you something about how it interpreted your prompt. Use that feedback loop: clarify, constrain, or expand your prompt accordingly.

---

**Closing Thoughts:** Prompt engineering for LLMs is a continually evolving skill. As models get more advanced, some techniques may change, but the core principle remains: **effective communication**. You already have deep expertise in physics, coding, and writing – think of prompt engineering as extending that expertise into a dialogue with the AI. By combining your domain knowledge with the prompting strategies covered in this guide, you can unlock even more powerful results from models like ChatGPT and Copilot. Keep this guide as a reference, but don’t hesitate to experiment beyond it. Every interaction is a chance to learn something new about how the model works. Stay curious, keep refining, and enjoy the process of co-creating with AI. Happy prompting!
