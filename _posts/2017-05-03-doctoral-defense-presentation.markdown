I am thinking about making the doctoral defense presentation
in Inpress.js or Reveal.js.
Maybe something simpler than Latex/Beamer both in the final result and
in the source code.
Also, integration with HTML is desirable to ease access.

Here I will post my first attempt to integrate these slides
into Jekyll in github pages.
