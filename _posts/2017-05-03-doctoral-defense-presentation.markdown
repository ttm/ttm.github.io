I am thinking about making the doctoral defense presentation
in Impress.js or Reveal.js.
Maybe something simpler than Latex/Beamer both in the final result and
in the source code.
Also, integration with HTML is desirable to ease access.

Here I will post my first attempt to integrate these slides
into Jekyll in github pages.

Good news!
The presentation is finished and at
[this other post!]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-05-03-presentation2.markdown %})

And I used it in the doctoral defense.

{% include presentation.html %}
