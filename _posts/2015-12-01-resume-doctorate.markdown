To finish my doctorate, the minimum is:

* Merge the [article on topological stability][atop] ([Supporting Information][sitop])
and the [article on textual differentiation][atxt] ([Supporting Information][sitxt])
through massive analysis of topological and textual social data.

It seems proper to end at least:

* End the [report on the ubiquity of inequality][ueq].
* End the [report on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and 'c' statistics][kol].
* Deepen the [Anthropological physics fundamentals][anp] and maybe contextualize it in a "complex networks gradus ad parnassum".

And also proper, but already too much, to make a:

* Description of the linked data legacy developed in this research.
* Description of the method for the creation of ontologies from databases.

Both scattered on [git repositories][ttmgh] and documents such as my last [pnud product][pnud5].

### Further notes

I should try to integrate this jekyll instance to aa shouts and other rdf data.

The software and data apparatus are constantly published.
