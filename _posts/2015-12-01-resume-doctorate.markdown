To finish my doctorate, the minimum is to:

* merge the [article on topological stability][atop] ([Supporting Information][sitop])
and the [article on textual differentiation][atxt] ([Supporting Information][sitxt])
through massive analysis of topological and textual social data.

It seems proper to end at least:

* the [report on the ubiquity of inequality][ueq].
* The [report on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and 'c' statistics][kol].

Maybe too much, but it also seems proper to:

* describe the linked data legacy developed in this research.
* Describe the method for the creation of ontologies from databases.
* Deepen the [Anthropological physics fundamentals][anp] and maybe contextualize it in a "complex networks gradus ad parnassum".

Which are scattered on [git repositories][ttmgh] and documents such as my last [pnud product][pnud5].

### Planning for today and the next days

Weekday   || Dec ||| milestones
----------||-----|||----------
Tuesday   || 01  ||| finish twitter, facebook, irc, email and other data rendering
Wednesday || 02  ||| render tables to SI; publish software
Thursday  || 03  ||| merge articles; add description of data and software legacy
Friday    || 04  ||| send merged article to Chu; finish article on inequality or KS and c statistics
Saturday  || 05  ||| finish the other article
Sunday    || 06  ||| describe linked data legacy
Monday    || 07  ||| describe the creation of ontologies from databases
Tuesday   || 08  ||| review with collabs
Wednesday || 09  ||| review with collabs
Thursday  || 10  ||| review with collabs; evaluate the pertinence of further documents and the monograph

To this should follow final adjustments with other interested parties
and maybe some delivery to peer review journals.

### Further notes

I should try to integrate this jekyll instance to aa shouts and other rdf data.

The software and data apparatus are constantly published.
