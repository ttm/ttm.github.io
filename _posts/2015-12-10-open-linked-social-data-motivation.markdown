Data produced by taxes, transactions and institutional bureauracy,
or by tecnological traces, are used daily by the State, private corporations,
and hybrid sectors, such as banking and some of the ONGs.
The individuals, as civilians, are left out of such harnessing.
This is a core motivation.

 Other motivation include:

- benchmarking, research

- self-knowledge

- art, aesthetic

- social paradigm shift
