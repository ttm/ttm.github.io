I'll hold a presentation today at [IPRJ](https://www.iprj.uerj.br/),
on academic and business opportunities related to Computing, Complexity, and Art.

I'll focus on demos as much as possible, and here is the [link to the slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11exifIFcF1hazIC3CMpxvFa6xBRON4gE7l2xba-UGSI/edit?usp=sharing).

It is a nice occasion to review my trajectory and directions I want to follow.
Thanks for everyone that will be (or has been) there.
