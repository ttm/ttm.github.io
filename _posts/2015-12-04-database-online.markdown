After two days finding data and converting it to RDF,
I finally finished a first set of datasets, all in
these [Github organization repos][gh].
It consists of dozens of friendship and interaction networks from Facebook,
about a dozen of sets of tweets, about a dozen of irc logs and some email lists.
More exquisite data include linked data from the Algorithmic Autoregulation, and from the Participabr and Cidade Democr√°tica participation portals.

This mini-legacy should ease next steps in reseaching human social systems,
specially in probing general properties and in delivering benchmarks.
